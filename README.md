Deep Learning Project.

Music Generation. In this project we wiil try to generate some music.

All the code used for this project is included in the Music Generation.ipynb colab notebook file.

How to run: One can either run the cells that have the LSTM tag on them, or the cells with the Autoencoder tags on them, or one can run the whole notebook cell by cell.

The midi files provided on this repository are the ones that stood out the most.

Neural Networks used: AUTOENCODER, LSTM

Metrics: Peoples' opinions

The Dataset used for this project can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/function9/blues-genre-midi-melodies

Installations needed for this project: Python 3.7.10, tensorflow 2.5.0, keras 2.5.0,  music21, numpy, pickle, glob
